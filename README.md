A pet adoption system typically refers to an organized process or platform through which individuals or families can adopt pets from animal shelters, rescue organizations, or other facilities. These systems often include procedures for matching pets with suitable adopters, providing information about the animals available for adoption, conducting screenings or interviews with potential adopters, and facilitating the adoption process itself, including paperwork and fees. The goal is to find loving homes for animals in need of adoption while ensuring responsible pet ownership.
